    <h2>Courses and Content</h2>
    <h3>Games and Tourism Curriculum</h3>
    <p>There are three courses offered for the Games and Tourism program.</p>
        <p><b>IGME 220 – Game Design and Development I </b><br>
            Can be taken before the program but must be completed by the end of the semester abroad.
            This course examines the core process of game design, from ideation and structured brainstorming 
            in an entertainment technology context through the examination of industry standard processes 
            and techniques for documenting and managing the design process. This course specifically examines 
            techniques for assessing and quantifying the validity of a given design, for managing innovation 
            and creativity in a game development-specific context, and for world and character design. Specific 
            emphasis is placed on both the examination and deconstruction of historical successes and failures, 
            along with presentation of ethical and cultural issues related to the design and development of 
            interactive software and the role of individuals in a team-oriented design methodology. Students 
            in this class are expected to actively participate and engage in the culture of design and critique 
            as it related to the field. 
        </p>

        <p><b>IGME 590 – Seminar in Games and Tourism</b></p>
                
        <p><b>IGME 580 – Production Studio </b><br>
            This course will allow students to work as domain specialists on teams completing one or more large 
            projects over the course of the semester. The projects will be relevant to experiences of the 
            Interactive Games and Media programs, but will require expertise in a variety of sub-domains, 
            including web design and development, social computing, computer game development, multi-user media, 
            human-computer interaction and streaming media. Students will learn to apply concepts of project 
            management and scheduling, production roles and responsibilities, and their domain skill sets to 
            multidisciplinary projects. Students will complete design documents, progress reports and final 
            assessments of themselves and their teammates in addition to completing their assigned 
            responsibilities on the main projects.
        </p>
            
    <p>Students must take a minimum of 12 credits to maintain their full-time status. 
        Listed below are classes recommended for Games and Tourism students.
    </p>
            
        <p><b>ENVS 150 – Ecology of the Dalmatian Coast</b><br>
            This course is an introduction to population, community, and ecosystem ecology; stressing the dynamic 
            interrelationships of plant and animal communities of the Dalmatian Coast.  The course includes 
            such ecological concepts as energy flow and trophic levels in natural communities, population and 
            community dynamics, biogeography and ecosystem ecology.  Field trips to local Croatian ecosystems 
            are included.
        </p>
            
        <p><b>ISTE 240 – Web and Mobile II</b><br>
            An equivalent course to IGME 230. This course builds on the basics of web page development that are 
            presented in Web & Mobile I and extends that knowledge to focus on theories, issues, and technologies 
            related to the design and development of web sites. An overview of web design concepts, including 
            usability, accessibility, information architecture, and graphic design in the context of the web 
            will be covered. Introduction to web site technologies, including HTTP, web client and server 
            programming, and dynamic page generation from a database also will be explored. Development 
            exercises are required.
        </p>
            
        <p><b>ISTE 252 – Foundations of Mobile Design</b><br>
            Considered a free elective. This course is an introduction to designing, prototyping, and creating 
            applications and Web Apps for mobile devices. These devices include a unique set of hardware and 
            communications capabilities, incorporate novel interfaces, are location aware, and provide persistent 
            connectivity. Topics covered include user interaction patterns, connectivity, interface design, 
            software design patterns, and application architectures. Programming projects are required.
        </p>
            
        <p><b>ISTE 340 – Client Programming</b><br>
            Considered a free elective. This course will explore the analysis, design, development, and 
            implementation of client-side programming in the context of Internet technologies, mobile devices, 
            Web-based client systems and desktop applications. Students will learn to design and build usable 
            and effective interactive systems, clients, and interfaces. Key features addressed will include 
            browser and platform compatibility, object reusability, bandwidth and communications issues, 
            development environments, privacy and security, and related technologies and APIs. Programming 
            is required.
        </p>

        <p><b>ISTE 442 – Web Application Development</b><br>
            Considered an IGM Advanced Elective. When building larger-scale web applications, there are a 
            myriad of concerns that range from technology, framework, and architecture selection to runtime 
            performance optimization. This course focuses on the development of integrated web applications 
            that consume information served from one or many sources. Trends in web application development 
            are identified and assessed. Programming projects are required.
        </p>
            
        <p><b>ISTE 444 – Web Server Development and Administration</b><br>
            Considered an IGM Advanced Elective. Web developers often need to go beyond building web pages 
            and client-server programming to plan, install, configure, develop, and maintain the Web servers 
            that host their sites. They need to understand issues of scalability, performance, and security as 
            they apply to deploying a web presence. This course provides a practical hands-on approach to 
            development, configuration, and administration of Web server platforms. Topics include issues of 
            and approaches to scalability, multiple server systems, security, and auditing, as well as the many 
            configuration options, modules, and server alternatives available.
        </p>
